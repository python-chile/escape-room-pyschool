Accepted ideas

- Dict: To translate a cyphered message
- For cycle: to test multiple passwords.
- Min,Max: To check vital signs of person.

Add "lifes" to the game, so they have to think before submitting an answer. Kinda like the "minigolf".
We can allow 10 minutes per game, then we solve and explain.

Basic Syntax & Variables
Math Operations Puzzle – A locked chest opens only if students compute the correct sum, difference, product, or quotient from a given equation.

Variable Swap Challenge – A riddle where two variables hold incorrect values, and students must swap them without using a temporary variable.

Conditionals & Boolean Logic
Logic Gates Lock – A safe opens only if students correctly apply AND, OR, NOT conditions to a set of given inputs.

Truth Table Code – A riddle requires evaluating multiple boolean expressions to find the correct combination.

Loops & Iteration
While Loop Countdown – A bomb defusal requires counting down from a specific number to zero using a while loop.

For Loop Cipher – A sequence of characters must be shifted forward using a for loop to reveal a hidden message.

Lists & Tuples
Sorting Riddle – A scrambled list of numbers (or words) must be sorted in ascending order to unlock a safe.

Indexing Challenge – A hidden word can only be revealed by accessing the correct indices of a list.

Dictionaries
Translation Dictionary – A coded message uses a dictionary to map symbols to letters, requiring a lookup to decipher.

Inventory System – A puzzle where students must track items using a dictionary and find a missing object.

String Manipulation
Palindrome Key – A clue requires checking if a given word is a palindrome before proceeding.

Substring Extraction – A message contains a hidden code that must be extracted using string slicing.

Functions & Modules
Broken Machine Repair – A function is missing key logic and must be completed correctly to operate a mechanism.

Randomized Code Generator – A lock requires running a function that uses random.randint() to generate the correct code.

File Handling
Hidden Message in a File – A text file contains a secret message, but students must write a script to extract specific lines.

Log File Analyzer – A server log contains errors; students must parse the file and find a key hidden within.

Regular Expressions (Regex)
Pattern Matching Code – A passage of text hides a phone number or password, requiring regex to extract it.

License Plate Validator – A locked car requires a correctly formatted license plate, which must be validated using regex.

OOP (Classes & Objects)
Robot Assistant – A broken robot needs a class definition with attributes and methods to interact with the players.

NPC Interaction – A puzzle where an NPC character has a speak() method, and students must fix or extend their functionality.

Recursion
Recursive Maze Solver – A labyrinth can only be solved with a recursive function exploring paths.

Fibonacci Code – A password is based on the nth Fibonacci number, requiring a recursive function to compute.

Datetime Module
Future Prediction Puzzle – A challenge where players must calculate the date of an event using datetime.timedelta.

Age Calculator – A clue requires figuring out someone’s age based on a given birthdate and today’s date.

Sorting & Searching
Binary Search Puzzle – A list of numbers contains a hidden code; students must implement binary search to find it.

Sorting Challenge – A set of mixed-up names or words must be sorted alphabetically to reveal a passphrase.

"The Lost Temple of Code"
🏺 Premise:
You are an adventurer and codebreaker on the trail of an ancient civilization that mysteriously disappeared. Legends speak of a temple that guards their greatest secret—a hidden artifact of immense power. However, the temple is filled with curses, traps, and logic-based puzzles designed to keep intruders out. You must solve them all using Python before the temple collapses!

⏳ The Challenge:
The door behind you has sealed shut, and the temple is crumbling. You have one hour to reach the treasure and escape alive!

Puzzles & Challenges
Each section of the temple has a Python-based puzzle that unlocks the next area:

1. "The Guardian’s Riddle" (Boolean Logic) 🗿
You reach an ancient stone door with four switches, each marked with strange symbols. A tablet beside it provides a riddle:
"Only those who understand true and false may enter."

You must set the correct True/False combination based on given conditions.

If you get it wrong, spears shoot from the walls!

2. "The Bridge of Numbers" (Loops & Conditionals) 🌉
A massive stone bridge stretches across a chasm, but some tiles are missing.

A plaque reads: “Only the correct sequence will hold your weight.”

A pattern of numbers is given, and you must use a for loop to identify which stones are safe.

Stepping on the wrong tile will cause the bridge to collapse!

3. "The Scroll of the Ancients" (Dictionaries & Strings) 📜
You find an ancient scroll covered in coded symbols. It contains a dictionary-based cipher that translates letters into words.

Using Python, you must decode the message to reveal the next clue.

The message warns: “Say the wrong words, and you shall be lost forever.”

If incorrect, sand fills the room, forcing you to escape fast!

4. "The Maze of the Forgotten" (Recursion) 🌀
You enter a labyrinth of tunnels, each leading in different directions.

The walls have markings showing recursive patterns.

You must write a recursive function to find the shortest path out.

If you take too long, the ceiling starts to collapse!

5. "The Treasure Chamber" (File Handling & Regex) 💎
At last, you find a massive stone vault protecting the legendary artifact!

The final challenge: a locked pedestal that requires an ancient passcode.

You find an old parchment with jumbled text—inside it is the password, hidden in a text file.

Using Python’s file handling and regex, you extract the passcode to unlock the treasure.

💡 Final Twist: As you grab the artifact, the temple starts collapsing! You must quickly rerun all previous scripts to retrace your steps and escape before being buried alive!

Why This Works
✅ Adventure & Mystery – Inspired by Indiana Jones, it’s immersive and thrilling.
✅ Clear Python Concepts – Covers conditionals, loops, dictionaries, recursion, file handling, and regex.
✅ High Stakes – Losing means getting trapped forever or setting off deadly traps!
